# C-Practice
C programming practice | College UDF, pointers, structures | Strong foundation for systems &amp; AI

Mastering C for college + real strength.  
Clean code, no shortcuts.

### 📂 Structure
- `/udf` → User Defined Functions practice
- `/pointers` → Later
- Each program in separate .c file

Pain = Gain. Like Bhishma's lifelong practice.

Jai Shri Ram 🙏
